<h2>VALORANT PROTOCOL ACTIVATED</h2>
<p><em>Split, 11 March 2020</em> – Tensions are running high across multiple realities today as reports flood in regarding an unprecedented surge in Radiant activity. VALORANT Protocol, the global task force established to combat these extra-dimensional threats, has officially declared a <b>"Code Red"</b> alert.
</p>
<p>Sources close to the Protocol confirm that spontaneous energy spikes, attributed to the enigmatic substance known as <b>Radianite</b>, have been detected globally. These spikes are manifesting as localized reality distortions, creating new skirmish zones that demand <b>immediate agent deployment.</b>
</p>
<p><em>"We're seeing an escalation unlike anything before,"</em> stated Commander Melissa "<b>Sage</b>" Jun, head of VALORANT's medical and containment division, in a rare public address. "The fabric of reality is being tested. Our agents are working tirelessly to contain these breaches and understand the source of this new surge."
</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts describe bizarre phenomena: structures appearing and disappearing, gravity-defying maneuvers by unknown entities, and aggressive energy signatures targeting civilian infrastructure. Citizens are advised to remain calm and follow all directives from local authorities and VALORANT Protocol announcements.
